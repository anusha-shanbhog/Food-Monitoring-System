Smart IOT Based Food Quality Monitoring System that senses the temperature, humidity and gases emitted using DHT11 and MQ135 sensors and sends it to Blync IOT Web dashboard to monitor and show the readings. 
ESP 32 microcontroller is used for the project and ESP 32 camera module is used to capture realtime images and send it to a telegram bot at the regular frequency. IT is built to reduce the wastage of food due to 
spoilage in the supply chain and can be used for packaged food, fruits and vegetables as well as food where a certain temperature has to be maintained. Further enhancements include automatically regulating the 
physical conditions like temperature in case it exceeds the threshold and usage of Machine LEarning to automatically detect and classify spoilt food from the real time images captured.
